# Olivier (Sympact06)

Hello there! 👋 I'm Olivier, better known in the digital realm as **Sympact06**. 

## About Me

I am a multifaceted tech enthusiast with an array of skills that range from programming to design. My journey started off as a curious teenager, diving deep into the realm of cheats, and I've since evolved into a (semi)professional with a penchant for ethical hacking and software development. 

🔐 **Certified Ethical Hacker by Cisco** - You can view my other certifications [here](https://www.credly.com/users/olivier-flentge/).

## What I Do

- 🎨 **Adobe Photoshop**: Whether it's creating mesmerizing graphics or photo editing, I have a flair for making visuals come alive.
  
- 💻 **Programming**: Proficient in C# and always keen on building robust applications that matter.
  
- 🌐 **Web Development**: Adept in PHP native apps with PDO. I believe in creating dynamic, secure, and scalable web solutions.

- 🕹 **Past Experience**: Developed cheats during my teen years. While I've grown past that phase, it has immensely shaped my understanding of software behavior and potential vulnerabilities.
